      <p class="info2">You can control aspects of the scene with the controls on the right as well as click and drag to orbit around the model.</p>
      <p class="info3">This website uses both a color map and a displacement map from NASA's official site.</p>
      <p class="info4">In order to get a better look at the geometry of the moon, you can increase/decrease the displacement scale on the right. However, extending too much can lead
      to visual artifacts. You can also enable wireframe mode for a clearer look at the vertices of the model. 
      Mess around with the other aspects of the scene, like the lighting and color.</p>
